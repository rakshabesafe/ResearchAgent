# AI Scientist Framework using PraisonAI
# This script implements the high-level design for an autonomous research agent.
#
# To run this code:
# 1. Make sure you have Python installed.
# 2. Install the PraisonAI library:
#    pip install praisonai
# 3. Set your LLM API key as an environment variable. For example, for OpenAI:
#    export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
#    (The script will default to a placeholder if no key is found)

# In a real-world scenario, these tools would perform complex actions like
# searching academic databases, running code in a secure sandbox, etc.
# For this demonstration, we are creating mock tools that simulate the output.
